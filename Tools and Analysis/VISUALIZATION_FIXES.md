# Visualization Fixes and Data Explanation

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Data Discrepancies Between Charts**

**The Problem:** The stacked bar chart and dot plot appeared to show different values for the same data.

**The Reality:** Both charts show the **same data** but represent it differently:
- **Stacked bar chart:** Shows cumulative totals per decade, with countries stacked in order
- **Dot plot:** Shows individual country values per decade for easier comparison

### 2. **1940s Data Clarification**

**Actual 1940s Data:**
- Guatemala: 661 records (highest contributor)
- Honduras: 230 records  
- El Salvador: 63 records
- Costa Rica: 25 records (NOT 1000+ as it might appear)
- Nicaragua: 37 records
- Panama: 1 record

**Why Costa Rica appeared "at the top" in stacked chart:**
- The stacked bar chart order is determined by data sorting, not by absolute values
- Costa Rica's 25 records were stacked on top of other countries' contributions
- The total 1940s bar height is 1,017 records (sum of all countries)

### 3. **Visualization Display Issues Fixed**

**Problems Fixed:**
- ✅ **Cut-off titles and legends:** Added proper margins and text sizing
- ✅ **Poor spacing:** Added spacing between plots
- ✅ **Inconsistent styling:** Standardized theme elements
- ✅ **Small text:** Increased font sizes for better readability

**Improvements Made:**
- Larger plot titles (16pt) with center alignment
- Better subtitle formatting (14pt)
- Increased axis label sizes (14pt bold)
- Improved legend formatting (12pt)
- Added proper margins (1cm on all sides)
- Better dot plot sizing with range c(2, 8)
- Added spacing between stacked bar and dot plots

### 4. **Table Formatting Issues Fixed**

**Problems Fixed:**
- ✅ **Raw HTML display:** Removed `print()` statements
- ✅ **Poor styling:** Added proper HTML formatting
- ✅ **Missing headers:** Added bold headers with red background
- ✅ **Poor readability:** Added striped rows and hover effects

**Improvements Made:**
- Direct table display without variable assignment
- Added `format = "html"` for proper rendering
- Enhanced styling with condensed layout
- Bold first column entries
- Red header background (`#D7261E`)
- Proper font sizing (12pt)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Both visualizations are correct** - they just represent the same data differently
2. **Costa Rica had 25 records in 1940s, not 1000+** - the stacked appearance was misleading
3. **Guatemala was the dominant contributor** in most decades, especially 1940s (661 records)
4. **The dot plot is more intuitive** for comparing individual country contributions
5. **All display issues have been resolved** with proper margins, sizing, and formatting
