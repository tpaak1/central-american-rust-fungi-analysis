# Visualization Options for Individual Country Values per Decade

## **4 Recommended Visualizations Created**

I've created 4 different visualization options to show individual country values per decade. Each serves a different purpose:

### **1. Faceted Line Plot** ⭐ **BEST FOR TRENDS**
**File:** `faceted_line_plot.png`

**Why it's great:**
- Shows each country in its own panel
- Easy to see individual country trends over time
- Identifies peak collection periods for each country
- No overlap between countries

**Best for:** Understanding when each country had their most active collection periods

**Key insights from your data:**
- **Guatemala:** Peak in 1940s (661 records), high activity in 1910s
- **Costa Rica:** Peak in 1910s, moderate activity in 2000s
- **Panama:** Recent activity in 2000s-2020s
- **Honduras:** Peak in 1940s (230 records)

### **2. Heatmap** ⭐ **BEST FOR COMPARISON**
**File:** `heatmap_plot.png`

**Why it's great:**
- Shows all countries and decades in one view
- Easy to spot high/low periods
- Numbers show exact values
- Lighter colors (yellow) indicate higher record counts

**Best for:** Quick visual comparison across all countries and decades

**Key insights:**
- Lighter colors (yellow) = more records
- Guatemala dominates in 1910s and 1940s
- Recent activity (2000s-2020s) shows different patterns
- Clear gaps in 1950s-1980s for most countries

### **3. Enhanced Dot Plot** ⭐ **BEST FOR PRECISE VALUES**
**File:** `enhanced_dot_plot.png`

**Why it's great:**
- Shows exact values with size coding
- Easy to compare specific countries
- Size indicates record count
- Color coding by country

**Best for:** Detailed analysis of specific decades or countries

**Key insights:**
- Largest dots = highest record counts
- Guatemala has the largest dots in 1910s and 1940s
- Costa Rica shows moderate but consistent activity
- Recent decades show smaller, more scattered dots

### **4. Bar Plot by Country** ⭐ **ALTERNATIVE VIEW**
**File:** `bar_by_country.png`

**Why it's great:**
- Side-by-side bars for each decade
- Easy to compare countries within decades
- Clear value representation
- Good for presentation

**Best for:** Showing country contributions within specific decades

## **My Top Recommendations:**

### **For Your Meeting Presentation:**
1. **Heatmap** - Best overall view, shows everything at once
2. **Faceted Line Plot** - Best for detailed country-by-country analysis

### **For Detailed Analysis:**
1. **Enhanced Dot Plot** - Best for precise value comparison
2. **Faceted Line Plot** - Best for trend analysis

### **For Publication/Reports:**
1. **Heatmap** - Professional, comprehensive view
2. **Bar Plot** - Traditional, easy to understand

## **Key Data Insights from All Visualizations:**

### **Peak Collection Periods:**
- **1910s:** Guatemala (peak), Costa Rica (high)
- **1940s:** Guatemala (peak), Honduras (high)
- **2000s:** Costa Rica, Panama (recent activity)

### **Country Patterns:**
- **Guatemala:** Dominant collector, peaks in 1910s and 1940s
- **Costa Rica:** Consistent moderate activity, peaks in 1910s
- **Panama:** Recent focus (2000s-2020s)
- **Honduras:** Peak in 1940s, moderate other periods
- **El Salvador:** Lower but consistent activity
- **Nicaragua:** Lower activity throughout
- **Belize:** Minimal activity

### **Temporal Gaps:**
- **1950s-1980s:** Low collection activity across most countries
- **Recent decades:** More diverse collection patterns

## **Files Created:**

### **PNG Images (High Quality):**
- `faceted_line_plot.png` - Individual country trends
- `heatmap_plot.png` - Comprehensive comparison
- `enhanced_dot_plot.png` - Precise value comparison
- `bar_by_country.png` - Alternative bar view

### **Updated HTML Report:**
- `central_american_rust_analysis.html` - Now includes all visualizations

## **Usage Recommendations:**

**For your meeting:**
- Use the **Heatmap** for the overview slide
- Use the **Faceted Line Plot** for detailed discussion
